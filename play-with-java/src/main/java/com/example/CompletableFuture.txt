Why CompletableFuture Can Be Inefficient
========================================

 -> Limited Concurrency Control:

    Relies on a shared ForkJoinPool, leading to potential thread starvation and bottlenecks.

 -> Fixed Thread Pool Size:

    The default thread pool size doesn't scale well under high load.

 -> Lack of Reactive Features:

    Doesn't support backpressure or flow control for dynamic workloads.

 -> Verbose Error Handling:

    Handling exceptions requires explicit chaining (e.g., exceptionally, handle).

 -> Complex Workflow Chaining:

    Deeply nested workflows become harder to read and maintain.

 -> Weak Timeout and Cancellation Support:

    Requires extra code to handle cancellations or timeouts for complex tasks.

Better Alternatives

  -> Reactive Frameworks (e.g., Project Reactor, RxJava):

     Advanced features like backpressure and stream processing.

  -> Project Loom (Java 19+):

    Virtual threads for easier concurrency with minimal overhead.

  -> Custom Executors:

    Tailored thread pool management for better scalability.
